# MINST and how do we go about teaching computer to distinguish 3 and 7 (Numbers Recognition).

Food for thoughts: how do you know if 3 is 3 and 7 is 7? 
- Oh well, back in kindergarten my teacher had us drawn them on paper, 3 looks curvy, kind of like an 8 spit in half, while 7 is more similar to 1. Yes, the curves are what help me tell them apart!

## 1. Designing a decent baseline
Vocab: *Tensors* = PyTorchâ€™s way to store and manipulate numeric data (like images, text embeddings, signals, etc.) on CPU or GPU.
- A decent baseline help you know if you have created a good model or a retarded one.
